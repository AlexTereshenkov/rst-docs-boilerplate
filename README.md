This is a boilerplate project for generating static HTML documentation 
using reStructuredText files.

To get started:

```
$ python3 -m venv docs-venv
$ source docs-venv/bin/activate
$ make clean; make html
```

You can now browse the docs at `build/html/index.html`.
See an example of these docs hosted at [Read the Docs page](https://rst-docs-boilerplate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
